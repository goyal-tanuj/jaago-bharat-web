          To make the new year happy and healthy our JAAGO BHARAT team
          distributed clothes to poor people in NOIDA, PATNA & KOTA. Team

        Team Jaago Bharat celebrated the 67th Republic Day, with the
        underprivileged children in cities Noida and Kota simultaneously. We
        distributed biscuits & chocolates among the underprivileged slum
        children of Sector 63, Noida and orphanage children of sector 12, Noida.
        Our team members also distributed chocolates in Kota too. We felt glad
        by giving smile on their faces.

          Under our "A Warm smile" campaign, on 26th January, our team members
          visited an orphanage in sector 12, Noida and spent several hours,
          dancing, singing with the kids. They taught kids about the history and
          relevance of Republic Day. They also told them the importance of
          cleanliness and hygiene in life. It was a real pleasure for them to
          meet those kids. The feeling and the satisfaction cannot be put into

        Team Jaago Bharat undertook the responsibility of spreading awareness
        about the dire need of managing the bio-degradable waste. To make it a
        point we cleared and cleaned the cycle track and Pedestrian walkway near
        Stellar IT park, Sec-62, Noida which had been completely converted to a
        dump yard. We segregated the collected waste into bio-degradable and
        non- biodegradable. The bio-degradable waste was disposed off using
        Khamba (wet waste composter) which converts the waste into fine manure
        within 40-45 days. Non-biodegradable waste was handed over to Kabadi
        walas, which we will later send for recycling.

      <Changedh2>About Project</Changedh2>
      <p>
        From 2016 our NGO used to conduct cleanliness drive. In our drive we
        also segregate wet waste and dry waste. The wet waste was given to cow
        to eat and dry waste was given to small recyclers.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2018 we started our project known as Wet waste composting, we had
        made our wet waste composter to promote home composting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020 we started to search for a society level composting project. In
        Oct 2021 we implement vermicompost model in GRADS International School,
        Gr Noida.
        <br />
      </p>
    </Changeddiv>
    <Changeddiv>
      <Changedh2>What is the project about</Changedh2>
      <p>
        Wet waste is totally biodegradable and is good for soil if decomposed
        properly. We have come up with a solution to decompose your wet waste.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Home composting : We have the Wet Waste Composter that can convert your
        wet waste (Only Kitchen Wet Waste) into fertiliser in 30 to 40 days by
        using a small and easy process given by us.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Vermicomposting: If you want to implement a composting model for your
        society or institution then
        <br />
        Vermicomposting is the best solution. We provide technical as well as
        help you to implement the vermi. Plant in your premise.

      <Changedh2>Why we need this</Changedh2>
      <p>
        According to Times of India Noida generates 600 tonnes of solid waste
        every day. According to solid waste management rules 2016 every waste
        generator or gated societies or institution (more than 5000 sq m) has to
        ensure segregation of the waste in separate bins, handover recyclable
        material to authorised recyclers, processing of biodegradable waste into
        manure.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We help individual waste generator or society/ institution to start
        making compost from their wet waste.

            it is estimated that urban India generates between 1,30,000 to
            1,50,000 metric tonne (MT) of municipal solid waste every day – some
            330-550 gramme per urban inhabitant a day. This adds up to roughly
            50 million MT per year; at current rates, this will jump to some 125
            million MT a year by 2031. All over India 30 per. waste is properly
            disposed rest is untreated.

              <br /> Rainwater can be collected from rivers, roof tops and the

                Water conservation is the need of the hour. Scarcity of water is

                Chennai, a city in South India witnessed a complete dry out of
                the reservoirs. A report by NITI Aayog, said that if methods for
                water conservation in India are not implemented, another 20
                cities including Bengaluru, Delhi and Hyderabad would run out of

                intensity and is prone to floods and waterlogging as well as

            Project S.M.I.L.E caters as a single solution to this three-fold
            problem. We generate employment and empower the unskilled and lesser
            privileged sections of our society. This not only makes them
            financially independent, but also increases their employability. The
            notebooks are made from recycled paper, thus directly reducing the
            amount of paper that is wasted. Some of the copies that are made and
            the old books that we get during collection are given to the slum
            children.

        <p>
          We got an idea about the concept of Ecobrick in March 2020. We did one
          year of research on that in which we got to know the persons living in
          Delhi NCR who are working in this.
          <br />
          <br />
          By March 2021 we collaborated with Enactus JMC and started making
          Ecobricks.

      <Changeddiv>
        <Changedh2>What is the project about?</Changedh2>
        <p>
          An ecobrick is a PET bottle packed solid with clean and dry plastics,
          meaning it’s a
          <br />
          <br />
          plastic bottle packed with used plastic to set density and to prevent
          the growth of bacteria.
          <br />
          <br />
          We collaborated with Enactus JMC to build a public toilet out of
          Ecobrick in Delhi for slum women. The project is going on and our aim
          is to make 2000 ecobricks made out of 1 litre plastic bottles and non
          recyclable clean & dry plastic waste.

        <Changedh2>Why we need this?</Changedh2>
        <p>
          Project Ecobrick caters as a single solution to this three-fold
          problem. It helps to eradicate the problem of non recyclable plastic
          waste which generally goes to landfill. Also it allows every
          individual who uses plastic for his personal use, to act on their
          plastic waste and upscale it to something more useful.
          <br />
          <br />
          We generate employment and empower the slum womens by training them on
          how to make ecobricks. This not only support their livelihood, but
          also increases their employability.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Ecobricks made has many practical applications like apart using
          them to make structures it can also be used to create stools, seats,
          tables and various other things for household purposes

              According to Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, India
              generates 3.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually. The only
              way to solve this problem is the person/family/community who
              generates this waste, takes initiative to reduce its plastic
              waste.

              force participation at 22.8 percent, compared to a far higher 56.8
              percent for men. The data shows that women’s presence in the
              workforce dropped to 16.9 percent following the first year of the
              pandemic, while for men it remained largely the same.

              India, even with the world’s highest recycling rate of 80 per

              Ecobrick making can be done from their home itself, so during

          All households, once or twice a year, segregate the old clothes and discards
          them. As per studies conducted, 73 per cent of all such clothes end up in
          landfill for various reasons such as lack of collection systems and ineffective
          redistribution. In a survey conducted in 2017, among young people aged
          between 20-30 years, it was found that 68% of the people buy new clothes
          every month and impulsive buying was the main reason behind their
          purchasing intention. Also, when asked, the majority of them responded that
          they would like to donate the discarded clothes to a NGO or any other
          charitable cause. But in the absence of any professional help, awareness and
          knowledge in this front, people end up dumping or reselling these clothes. It is
          estimated that with the current pace of urban waste being generated, India
          will need a fresh landfill of the same size as that of its capital, New Delhi.
          Further, reselling these clothes benefits only the traders and does nothing to
          improve the economic health of the needy. However, donating such clothes to
          our organization will help us solve a bigger problem. As a society, it is our
          responsibility and moral duty to help economically backward people to raise
          their living standards.

        Jaago Bharat Front, through its initiative Vastraay, looks forward to serving the
        purpose of both providing employment to the women population in slum areas
        
        and managing waste through utilization of old clothing. As the name suggests,
        Vastraay is Vastra + Aay, which means Earning through Clothes. In Vaastray we
        are dedicated to the cause of educating women, living in slums, to make usable
        things such as masks, rugs, doormats, bags, etc. through reusing old clothes.
        Vastraay is one such effort of Jaago Bharat that aims at the economic and skill
        development of such people while catering to the issue of waste management.
        What we do with the old clothes is not the recycling but the upcycling, which is
        a greener version of the recycling. Unlike recycling, upcycling does not involve
        breaking down of clothes material/fabric through any
        chemical/heat/mechanical process rather involves conversion of one form of
        cloth to the other through the means of cutting and stitching, thus changing
        the usability of the cloth.</Changeddiv>
      <Changeddiv>
          Another NGO, i.e.Jan Jagriti Foundation has joined hands with us to help in this
          noble cause and has donated a few stitching machines, which are being used
          to train these women to make carry bags, masks, doormats, pillow covers etc.
          out of old clothes. This way we are able to develop a community of artisans,
          who through their skillset can improve its standard of living.</Changeddiv>
          <Changeddiv>Further, Jaago Bharat organizes small Melas/Trade Fairs in societies/residential
          complexes, thus providing a platform for these hand-made products to be sold.
          We would like to invite every responsible citizen to contribute to this noble
          cause by donating their old clothes, time or funds. It is only through the
          channelized efforts of aware citizens that we can make a positive difference to
          the community and the environment.
