      Team Jaago Bharat undertook the responsibility of spreading awareness
      about the dire need of managing the bio-degradable waste. To make it a
      point we cleared and cleaned the cycle track and Pedestrian walkway near
      Stellar IT park, Sec-62, Noida which had been completely converted to a
      dump yard. We segregated the collected waste into bio-degradable and
      non- biodegradable. The bio-degradable waste was disposed off using
      Khamba (wet waste composter) which converts the waste into fine manure
      within 40-45 days. Non-biodegradable waste was handed over to Kabadi
      walas, which we will later send for recycling.

      <p>
        From 2016 our NGO used to conduct cleanliness drive. In our drive we
        also segregate wet waste and dry waste. The wet waste was given to cow
        to eat and dry waste was given to small recyclers.
        <br />

      <p>
        In 2018 we started our project known as Wet waste composting, we had
        made our wet waste composter to promote home composting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020 we started to search for a society level composting project. In
        Oct 2021 we implement vermicompost model in GRADS International School,

        properly. We have come up with a solution to decompose your wet waste.
        <br />

      <p>
        Home composting : We have the Wet Waste Composter that can convert your
        wet waste (Only Kitchen Wet Waste) into fertiliser in 30 to 40 days by
        using a small and easy process given by us.

        Vermicomposting: If you want to implement a composting model for your
        society or institution then
        <br />
        Vermicomposting is the best solution. We provide technical as well as
        help you to implement the vermi. Plant in your premise.

      <Changedh2>Why we need this</Changedh2>
      <p>
        According to Times of India Noida generates 600 tonnes of solid waste
        every day. According to solid waste management rules 2016 every waste
        generator or gated societies or institution (more than 5000 sq m) has to
        ensure segregation of the waste in separate bins, handover recyclable
        material to authorised recyclers, processing of biodegradable waste into
        manure.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We help individual waste generator or society/ institution to start
        making compost from their wet waste.

            330-550 gramme per urban inhabitant a day. This adds up to roughly
            50 million MT per year; at current rates, this will jump to some 125
            million MT a year by 2031. All over India 30 per. waste is properly

              This project talks about the implementation of a rainwater

              Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and storage of rainwater
              for reuse.
              <br /> Rainwater can be collected from rivers, roof tops and the
              water collected is directed to a deep pit. The water percolates
              and gets stored in the pit. This is not just an economical
              practice but is sustainable too.

                Water conservation is the need of the hour. Scarcity of water is
                a serious concern that the world is facing now. In the year 2019
                Chennai, a city in South India witnessed a complete dry out of
                the reservoirs. A report by NITI Aayog, said that if methods for
                water conservation in India are not implemented, another 20
                cities including Bengaluru, Delhi and Hyderabad would run out of
                groundwater in the next few years.
              </li>
              <li>
                The city of Noida has seen a significant declining trend (up to
                40 mbgl) because of over-extraction. Since the area is
                surrounded by the river Yamuna, all the storm water drains into
                it. However, because of increased paved areas and declining
                waterbodies in Noida, the area cannot sustain high rainfall
                intensity and is prone to floods and waterlogging as well as
                depleting groundwater levels.

          groundwater levels. The quality of groundwater is also not upto the
          mark. Rainwater harvesting is an effective method of conserving

        <p>
          Project S.M.I.L.E caters as a single solution to this three-fold
          problem. We generate employment and empower the unskilled and lesser
          privileged sections of our society. This not only makes them
          financially independent, but also increases their employability. The
          notebooks are made from recycled paper, thus directly reducing the
          amount of paper that is wasted. Some of the copies that are made and
          the old books that we get during collection are given to the slum
          children.

          We got an idea about the concept of Ecobrick in March 2020. We did one
          year of research on that in which we got to know the persons living in
          Delhi NCR who are working in this.
          <br />
          <br />
          By March 2021 we collaborated with Enactus JMC and started making
          Ecobricks.

        <p>
          An ecobrick is a PET bottle packed solid with clean and dry plastics,
          meaning it’s a

          plastic bottle packed with used plastic to set density and to prevent
          the growth of bacteria.

          <br />
          We collaborated with Enactus JMC to build a public toilet out of
          Ecobrick in Delhi for slum women. The project is going on and our aim
          is to make 2000 ecobricks made out of 1 litre plastic bottles and non
          recyclable clean & dry plastic waste.

        <p>
          Project Ecobrick caters as a single solution to this three-fold
          problem. It helps to eradicate the problem of non recyclable plastic
          waste which generally goes to landfill. Also it allows every
          individual who uses plastic for his personal use, to act on their
          plastic waste and upscale it to something more useful.
          <br />
          <br />
          We generate employment and empower the slum womens by training them on
          how to make ecobricks. This not only support their livelihood, but
          also increases their employability.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Ecobricks made has many practical applications like apart using
          them to make structures it can also be used to create stools, seats,

        <Changedh2>What we get after installing or doing this?</Changedh2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We trained more than 20 slum women on how to make ecobricks.
              Ecobrick making can be done from their home itself, so during
              COVID it became a good source of extra income.
            </li>
            <li>
              They became skilled and hence this project itself promotes Women
              empowerment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our Team member organised several cleanliness drives in Noida,
              where we picked up the plastic from streets & parks lying there
              for several days or even months, cleaned it and used it in
              Ecobrick making.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volunteers learnt a lot of things of managing operational costs,
              planning to pick huge sums of plastic, convincing people and mall
              authorities to give their plastic.
